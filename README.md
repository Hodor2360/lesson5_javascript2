### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A lesson that I learned during lesson 5 would be the usage of functions, comparing functions to methods, the functions syntax and the usage of arguments in functions
2. Another interesting lesson we learned was how the use of arguments in a function help make the snippit of code reusable for different uses.
3. Lastly we learned about the dry method of coding. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). Using funcitons and arguments help keep you from coding a whole new function. All you would have to do is reuse the code but with different arguments.
